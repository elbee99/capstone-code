# capstone-code

This is code I used to plot data during my capstone project. It is messy and
awful but does the job. I initially just used Python I wrote through Vim and
ran from the terminal but eventually switched to Jupyter notebooks as it was
easier to make different plots at different times that way.

I may improve this code after the project as a practice, we will see.
